               <p><h3>CHAPTER 1</h3>
Phoenix in July. People called it Mother Nature’s rendition of hell on earth.

They were wrong. Hell existed on the other side of the world, in a much more treacherous desert. If it let you go, you ran, as long and hard and as fast as you could to escape.

But sometimes even running didn’t work, I tried. I spent the last six months, jumping from one remote place to another, chasing wildlife with a camera for a paycheck. A safer endeavor than chasing two footed monsters.

Unfortunately, there was one thing I couldn’t outrun, family. Or the closest thing to it in my case, Kelsey. Sister by circumstances, not blood, and the only human on the planet I would consider returning to civilization for. Right now, she should be on her own plane with a group of fellow lawyers for some boring-ass conference. Her words, not mine. Instead, she managed to get a message to me, despite me being in the wilds of America’s last frontier. Someone was asking questions about me and watching her.

Which meant one disturbing message and eight hours later, I found myself crammed into the sardine can doubling as a plane. As it rolled to a stop on the tarmac, I moved into the narrow aisle, squishing between a young mother holding a squirming toddler, and a heavy set, cranky businessman as we jockeyed for a place.

Juggling my camera bag while I dug out my cell phone didn’t do much to endear me to my fellow passengers either. Since our flight out of Fairbanks, Alaska had been delayed, everyone wanted off, right now. People were pulling out bags and resetting their various electronic devices.

Muted conversations swelled around me while the toddler took advantage of his mother’s inattention to flash me a gap-tooth grin. I wiggled my fingers in return. His grin widened, at least until his mom distracted him with a stuffed toy.

Thumbing my phone’s screen, I discovered seven missed calls and two voice mails. Nerves tightened.

Numbers scrolled across my incoming call list. The first one held a 619-area code. Coronado, California. It repeated twice. My stomach lurched and old anger snarled. I scrolled past it like all the others I’d received in the last few months, and then found the one I needed. It was listed four times.

Damn it!</p> 
<p>
My stomach roiled.

I hit the icon to retrieve my voicemails, then tucked the phone between my shoulder and ear. It made pulling my battered backpack from the overhead compartment tricky. Finally getting it free, I settled the strap on my shoulder, only then able to reclaim my phone.

The awkward juggle allowed me to ignore the strange visual dance of adverted glances from my fellow passengers. The burn scars curling under my jaw and dripping like delicate lace down my neck before disappearing under my T-shirt were hard to miss. Hell, even I wasn’t used to them yet.

“Cyn? You need to call me as soon as you land.” Frantic and breathless, I almost didn’t recognize Kelsey’s voice. My fingers tightened on my phone. “Look, there’s been a change of plans. I’m heading north to hole up and wait for you.” Her harsh breathing was audible over the rumblings of the departing passengers as we shuffled to the exit. “Whoever’s been watching me, I think they got in my condo. You know that itch you talk about? Yeah, well it’s graduated to hives.” Her voice became muffled, and then cleared, “…not comfortable sharing over the phone, so just hurry the hell up and get here, okay?”

The next message came from the same area code so I didn’t bother listening. I hit speed dial, praying Kelsey would pick up. Her phone rang and went to voicemail. “Kels, it’s me. I’m on my way. Call me back.” I checked to see when she called. Forty-five minutes ago.

Stuck in the exit shuffle, I hit the oven masquerading as the jetway at a stuttering run. Once there was room, I dodged through the zombie-like crowd of departing passengers, ignoring the muttered complaints trailing in my wake.

Like I gave a shit right now.

Kelsey was an up-and-coming corporate lawyer in a Phoenix law firm and the last person to panic. The underlying fear in her message scared the bejesus out of me because we had both navigated the wonderfully warped world of foster care with guts and bravado. That was until the Ardens took us in as teenagers.

My bags thumped against my shoulders and hips as my booted feet pounded down the seemingly never-ending airport corridors. Exiting through the automated doors, the sucking wall of a hundred-plus degrees of Phoenix summer put a hitch in my step. I hopped on the shuttle for long-term parking.

As it made its way to where I parked my Jeep two and a half weeks ago, I tried Kelsey’s number again. No answer. Next call was to my cabin up north. The stupid machine picked up. “Kels? Are you there?” I waited, trying not to pant like a racehorse. Nothing. Sickening dread tightened my stomach muscles. Third call was her condo in Tempe. Nothing.

The shuttle lurched to a stop at the curb in a cloud of exhaust. I ran, weaving my way through the blistering metal of parked cars under the relentless afternoon sun, my T-shirt sticking to my back like a leech.

Finding my Jeep, I threw my backpack in the back and, with a little more care, set my padded camera bag on the passenger floorboard. Habit had me plugging in my phone before I settled behind the wheel. Not waiting for my poor air conditioner to beat back the searing heat, I started the engine, navigated out of the lot, and hit the freeway.

My fingers danced on the steering wheel with frenetic worry and my left leg bounced like a piston. My body got busy stressing out, while my mind remained startlingly clear. The dichotomy felt all too familiar. Lessons learned during my stint with the U.S. Marine’s Intelligence Unit stuck like glue. Logic took center stage, shoving my emotions to the side, and survival became the name of the game.

Kelsey would head north to the cabin we inherited in Sedona from our foster parents. The one I called home when I bothered to stick around. A little haven of security tucked away from the world. It was listed under our foster mother’s maiden name and known only to us, which made it a perfect hideout.

A glance at the Jeep’s dash confirmed there was enough gas to get me there. If I followed the speed limit, I should hit Sedona in little over two hours. I sent a quick prayer to whatever deities were listening and pressed my foot on the gas. Speed limits be damned.


By the time the exit for Sedona appeared, my raging emotions had crowded out logic, insisting on mentally torturing me with scenarios more in line with those slasher films Kelsey loved so much. It left my stomach and head a mess.

Regardless of Sedona’s beauty, the towering, red rock cliff faces weren’t doing a thing for my photographer’s heart. My jaw ached, and it’d be a miracle if I didn’t crack a tooth. With one main road in and out of town, traffic was a meandering crawl.

Fifteen of the longest minutes of my life passed before I turned onto the semi-paved road winding up Oak Creek Canyon. Taking it faster than normal, I bounced along the rough road, trailing a cloud of dust and marking my passage through every turn.

My home came into view as I cleared the last bend. Kelsey’s older model Lexus sat to the side of the cabin and the tight bands across my chest began to loosen in relief.

Scattered trees stood guard in the partially cleared front yard. Two old Juniper trees flanked the raised wraparound front porch and the half-moon drive. Various desert shrubs and flowers added a cheerful splash of color to the scene.

The Jeep came to a skidding halt on the loose gravel. Scrambling out, my weak leg threatened to fold under me, the stiff muscles a reminder that six months was not long enough for my body to forget the damage dealt to it.

I grabbed the metal doorframe for support, and heat seared my palm. My breath escaped in a pain-filled hiss as I readjusted my hold and studied the house. The afternoon shadows weren’t deep, but unless they were playing tricks on me,

<h3>CHAPTER 2</h3>
Shock held me motionless at actually hearing Kelsey’s warning. It meant something, but damned if I knew what. There was no ‘normal’ for reliving the past, no handy user guide.

What had changed?

The images were gone, but there had to be something more. Something I could use. Even as my head began to pound, I kept my weird other sight open and retraced my steps through the hall, frantically searching for any other signs. Anything I might have missed.

The swirling images coalesced in a confused blur and faded even faster, as if my intensity chased them away. Frustration peaked.

Maybe if I went back to my room and started over?

As I passed the front door, a shadow wavered across the glass-block window. I froze. Someone, a large someone, stood outside the door. My gaze dropped to the doorknob. Unlocked.

Shit!

It began to turn slowly. I had a handful of seconds before it would open. Slamming my mental walls back up sent a ferocious ache behind my eyes, but the need to know what was real and now, and what wasn’t, was critical. The door crept open.

Praying the glass column wouldn’t give away my presence, I carefully shifted against the wall behind the door. As the door continued to move, it also blocked line of sight. Of course, whoever was behind it, couldn’t see me either.

Which meant I had one shot. Wrapping my hand on the knob, I shoved my shoulder and weight into the door, slamming it forward.

A muffled grunt confirmed the presence of a real, live body. Unfortunately, the door encountered a freaking battering ram and bounced back. Since I didn’t want to be stuck between the door and the wall, I stumbled out of the tight space and into the hall. My weak leg did not like the twists and turns, but I needed distance from whoever came through my door and my escape routes were limited.

<h3>CHAPTER 3</h3>
“Start talking.”

It was a demand, ice cold and filled with protective rage. A rage that barely concealed a noxious mix of fear, worry, and sickening terror. Vicious, graphic images twisted through my mind. If Kelsey was in the hands of the psycho who stalked my nightmares, I knew too well what horrors she could be enduring. It was times like this when I abhorred how much shit lived in my head.

“Ellery escaped custody.” Kayden’s answer was brutally short.

“Escaped?”

“During transport to Pendleton, five months ago.”

“Five months?” Shock wiped out my higher brain functions and left me sounding like a parrot. I pushed unsteadily to my feet. When Kayden rose to help me, I waved him off. Gripping the counter, I kept my back to him and did my best to untangle my gnarled thoughts.

Eleven months ago, I was assigned to a specialized, eight-person team to unravel the who and why behind the theft and possible sale of information on an experimental weaponized virus delivery system. It took us five months to uncover the who and close in. Unfortunately, the cost of bringing in Master Sergeant Reeve Ellery to stand trial for espionage had been high. Too high. Two of my team came home in flag-draped coffins. One of which belonged to my mentor and friend, Flash.

Ugly memories stirred, a bitter reminder of the price I was forced to pay. A price that looked as if I was still paying. The question was, why?

Granted, my testimony, as questionable as it was, helped cement Ellery’s conviction, but most of the evidence rested on previously gathered intel. My remaining four team members had been “unavailable”. Actual translation—hiding behind bigger uniforms or tucked away on classified missions. Which left me facing Ellery, the inquiry board, and their uncomfortable questions all alone. A situation that still chaffed my ass.

Old hurts didn’t matter. Couldn’t matter. Finding Kelsey, getting her back, that was all that mattered now. “And you think he has Kelsey? Why?”
